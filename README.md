# ‚öóÔ∏è  CoroCtx

This is a set of experiments I threw together to demonstrate coroutine context
variables: dynamically scoped, automatically shared across fibers, threads, and
even ractors (WIP).  They can be thought of as safer version of global vars, or
as a way to the most common issues with Thread and Fiber locals.

This particular repo (or at least, this branch) is not an illustration of my
desired API, nor does it represent how I think this could be implemented "For
Real".  It was just something I threw together, mostly on my phone during a long
road trip.

I've written some version of this code at least half a dozen times, and some of
my earlier (simpler, no tracepoint) iterations have been used in production.
This code *has not* been used in production.  Caveat emptor.

At some point in my experimentation, I started playing more with building out
some haphazard tools for working with ractors, and I never did get the ractors
code to work the way I wanted.
